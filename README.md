The size of the library is to much to push to github like 5GB so I'll include a link to how to set it up, due to CUDA version not working properly on my laptop I use the CPU version. Link to pytorch official setup https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html (didn't work for me, uses CMake) and this tutorial doesn't require CMake  https://khushi-411.github.io/setting-pytorch-api-c++/ (this was the one that worked for me)
